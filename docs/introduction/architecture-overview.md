# Arda Architecture Overview

---

## Overview

Arda's architecture is a vertically integrated, modular system for enabling real-world assets to be tokenized, traded, financed, and governed across jurisdictions. It is organized across six primary layers, each serving a specific role in delivering trust, compliance, and composability in private markets.

---

## Layered Stack

### 1. **Core Protocol Layer**
- Defines Arda's primitives: tokens (Asset, Money, Debt, Yield), identity (Entities, KYC), compliance rules, and lifecycle logic (Drawdown, Settlement).
- Encoded in a deterministic, no-VM logic format for auditability and control.

### 2. **Execution Layer (ArdaOS)**
- Regionally deployed sovereign rollups or chains.
- Enforce local compliance, residency, and performance requirements.
- Tailored to government and institutional needs (e.g. Dubai, NY, Singapore).

### 3. **Coordination Layer (Arda Core)**
- Shared services layer across sovereign chains.
- Responsible for identity registry, compliance rule sets, governance, liquidity routing, and global semantics (e.g. rights classification).
- Includes the Arda Vault (privacy-preserving data layer) and Arda Clear (settlement engine).

### 4. **Application Layer**
- Composed of products like:
  - **Arda Capital**: lending, issuance, capital formation
  - **Arda Trading**: secondary markets, RFQs, exchanges
  - **Arda Foundry**: legal SPV & wrapper generation
- Exposed via SDKs and platform APIs.

### 5. **Agentic Coordination Layer**
- Modular software agents (e.g. Risk Agent, Monitoring Agent, Structuring Agent) automate workflows.
- Agents perform underwriting, flagging, benchmarking, investment memo generation, and deal monitoring.

### 6. **Data & Intelligence Layer**
- Semantic data model standardizes how assets, deals, and rights are represented.
- Supports real-time analytics, AI augmentation, and structured reporting.
- Powers the Intelligence Protocol and programmable filters for capital matching.

## Interoperability & Standards

- Modular bridges with L2s, EVM, IBC, and traditional systems (via ISO/SWIFT standards).
- Agent SDK and governance APIs allow integration with fintechs, banks, and public registries.

## Future-Proofing

- Designed to support:
  - Cross-chain liquidity
  - Multi-asset collateralization
  - Programmatic underwriting and syndication
  - Embedded legal enforceability
