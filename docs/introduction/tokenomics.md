# Tokenomics

Arda’s programmable capital platform is underpinned by a dual-token model and a compliance-first token factory architecture. This page outlines the foundational token types in the Arda ecosystem, their roles, and future expansion plans.

## Core Tokens

### 1. ARDA (Native Protocol Token)
The ARDA token is the native coin of the Arda network and serves as the foundational economic and governance instrument.

**Functions:**
- Pay protocol-level transaction and service fees
- Stake for protocol governance and network security
- Participate in governance decisions (protocol upgrades, treasury allocation)
- Earn rewards via staking and protocol contributions

### 2. Arda Stablecoin (Region-Specific)
Arda chains may issue a compliant, fiat-backed or regulated stablecoin that reflects local currency value (e.g., ArdaUSD, ArdaAED).

**Functions:**
- Serve as the unit of account for real estate and capital transactions
- Enable compliance-first settlement with integrated KYC/AML enforcement
- Plug into escrow, waterfall, and loan repayment modules

## Token Factory

The Arda Token Factory module enables compliant issuance of custom, on-chain financial representations. These tokens are modular and programmable, supporting transfer restrictions, vesting logic, and lifecycle automation.

### Categories of Factory-Issued Tokens

#### Ownership Tokens
- Represent direct or fractional ownership of real-world properties or entities (e.g., SPVs)
- Linked to legal wrappers (e.g., Delaware LLCs, Dubai SPVs)
- Subject to jurisdictional transfer restrictions

#### Representative Tokens
- Mirror the ownership tokens but are optimized for trading or use as collateral
- Can be wrapped or reissued versions of core asset tokens
- Useful in liquidity pools, cross-chain transfer, or synthetic index creation

#### Loan Tokens
- Represent on-chain obligations like mortgages, bridge loans, or structured notes
- Contain payment schedule metadata, interest terms, and amortization logic
- Traded or syndicated via Arda’s programmable capital markets

#### Equity Tokens
- Track the residual or preferred value of an underlying asset (e.g., mezzanine tranches)
- Integrate with Waterfall distribution contracts
- Potentially tied to governance rights or dividend flows

## Governance & Incentives

Arda’s governance structure enables token-weighted participation, reputation gating, and compliance-enforced roles.

**Mechanisms:**
- On-chain DAO voting via ARDA token
- Reputation boosts for verified contributors (agents, data providers, liquidity suppliers)
- Treasury incentives for onboarding strategic assets or participants

**Incentive Recipients:**
- Agents (structuring, risk, monitoring)
- Originators and asset onboarders
- Data providers and oracle publishers
- Investors staking capital into programmable pools

## Future Token Concepts

- **Yield Tokens**: Stream future cashflows from property rent, escrow interest, or waterfall tranches.
- **Tranche Tokens**: Represent senior/mezz/junior risk profiles in syndicated loans or real estate projects.
- **Permissioned Pool Shares**: Tokenized shares in capital pools gated by investor KYC tier and strategy mandate.

## Compliance by Design

All tokens issued in Arda adhere to a “compliance-by-default” design:
- Whitelist-based transfer enforcement
- Region-aware permissioning logic
- Lifecycle event logging for audit and transparency
- Optional zk-based attestations for private transfer proofs

## Summary

Arda’s token architecture is modular, jurisdiction-aware, and future-proof. The native ARDA token and stablecoin form the backbone of protocol activity and compliance-enabled settlement. Around them, the Token Factory supports programmable real-world finance across ownership, credit, and liquidity domains.
