## 🧭 Overview

Arda Foundry is the protocol-native legal entity and structure creation system. It automates the instantiation of SPVs, trusts, funds, and other wrappers to provide legal enforceability and investor protections for real-world asset tokenization.

Foundry is essential for bridging the on-chain logic of Arda with the off-chain legal frameworks that govern real estate, credit, and structured products.

## 📜 Compliance & Validity

- Document notarization or regulator-issued filings can be anchored in Vault
- Vault entries link document + metadata + hash + jurisdiction
- KYC/KYB required for directors and founding entities
- Expiry, modification, or revocation updates status across protocol

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

- SDK includes `createEntity()`, `bindAsset()`, `registerDoc()`
- Role permissions programmable via policy templates
- Events logged into `AuditLog` and indexed via `FacilityRegistry`

## 🧪 Example Flow

1. Developer creates a Dubai SPV to hold a commercial building
2. Files Articles of Association + title deed to Arda Vault
3. Mints AssetToken and links it to the SPV via Foundry
4. Investors participate in PermissionedPool governed by that SPV
5. Monthly rent routed to SPV, then to TrancheToken holders
