## üß≠ Overview

Arda Core is the global coordination layer of the Arda architecture. It provides shared infrastructure across sovereign Arda OS chains, enabling standardized semantics, identity registry, compliance enforcement, and global liquidity routing. It acts as the "semantic and compliance operating system" for Arda‚Äôs ecosystem.

## üß± Key Modules

### 1. **Arda Taxonomy**
- A shared data model for describing assets, rights, entities, and relationships.

- Privacy-preserving data layer for sensitive documents (e.g. deeds, SPV docs, valuations).
- Supports:
  - FHE/MPC-encrypted access control
  - Document anchoring
  - Queryable zero-knowledge proofs

### 3. **Arda Compliance**
- Dynamic compliance engine and registry.
- Includes:
  - KYC / AML Engine
  - JurisdictionProfile
  - TransferRule
  - AuditLog
- Governs all cross-chain, cross-border activity.

### 4. **Arda Governance**
- Upgrades and rule changes are driven via decentralized governance.
- AIPs define schema evolution, protocol parameters, and jurisdictional rules.

### 5. **Arda Clear**
- Global clearing and net settlement engine.
- Supports:
  - Cross-chain transaction routing
  - Delayed or escrowed settlement
  - Fiat settlement anchoring
