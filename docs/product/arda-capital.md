## 🧭 Overview

Arda Capital is the programmable capital formation and lending layer of the Arda stack. It enables compliant issuance, syndication, and structuring of real-world asset-backed facilities, such as mortgages, credit lines, construction loans, and tokenized debt pools.

Built on Arda’s core primitives, Arda Capital integrates lifecycle logic, compliance, and programmable underwriting into a unified experience.

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. **Facility Creation**
- Programmable wrappers for debt or equity instruments.
- Supports legal anchoring via Arda Foundry.
- Can be created via SDK or UI with defined rulesets and triggers.

### 2. **Capital Formation**
- Primary market fundraising via PermissionedPools.
- Supports investor mandates, pro-rata allocation, soft/hard caps.
- Integrated with compliance and jurisdiction gating.

### 3. **Drawdown Mechanics**
- Partial or full drawdown support.
- Triggered by milestone checks, oracle data, or governance.
- Each drawdown event linked to repayment schedule and DebtToken issuance.

### 4. **Interest and Repayment Logic**
- InterestAccrual model supports fixed, floating, step-up, or indexed terms.
- Repayment tracked on-chain and broadcast to YieldToken holders.
- Default triggers can pause disbursement or initiate liquidation.

### 5. **Structuring and Syndication**
- Facility may be sliced into TrancheTokens with defined risk profiles.
- Waterfall logic and AllocationEngine govern distribution.
- Syndication via programmable pools (e.g. Sharpe > 2, LTV < 70%).

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. SPV deploys a facility via Foundry
2. Capital raised via PermissionedPool (KYC Tier 2+ only)
3. Drawdowns initiated as construction phases complete
4. Interest split between TrancheToken holders
5. Facility closes, debt burned, residual equity distributed
