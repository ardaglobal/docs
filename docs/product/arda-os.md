# Arda OS

> **Status**: Stable  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-06-23

## üß≠ Overview

Arda OS is the regional execution environment layer within the Arda architecture. Each Arda OS instance operates as a sovereign, compliant, high-performance blockchain tailored to the needs of a specific jurisdiction. These chains integrate with Arda Core to ensure shared semantics, compliance rules, and interoperability.

---

## üåç Design Philosophy

- **Sovereign by Default**: Each region controls validators, compliance schema, and data residency.
- **Vertically Integrated**: Includes execution logic, compliance checks, treasury flows, and event triggers natively.
- **Coordination-Enabled**: Synchronizes with Arda Core for cross-region functionality and shared identity.

## üß± Core Features

### 1. **POA / Rollup Architecture**
- Supported as sovereign Proof-of-Authority chains or zk-enabled rollups.
- Optimized for <100ms latency and regional scalability.

### 2. **Localized Compliance Layer**
- KYC/AML, jurisdiction rules, investor limits, and transaction gating enforced on-chain.
- Built on the same primitives as Arda Core but scoped to local legal frameworks.

### 3. **Arda Network-as-a-Service (NaaS)**
- Regional deployments on cloud or local infra (e.g. AWS Middle East, EU on-prem).
- Ensures compliance with data localization laws and regulator access.

### 4. **Validator Coordination**
- 3‚Äì7 regionally approved validators per chain.
- Includes notaries, registrars, public agencies, or approved financial institutions.

### 5. **Native Asset Support**
- Region-specific MoneyTokens, AssetTokens, DebtTokens, and YieldTokens.
- Customizable bridge wrappers and token templates.

### 6. **Shared Security & Compliance**: Inherit global compliance rules and validator security from Arda Core.
### 7. **Low-Cost, High-Throughput**: Optimized for enterprise-grade workloads without the high fees of public mainnets.

## üîÅ Cross-Chain Coordination

- Cross-region transactions routed through Arda Clear.
- Arda OS instances interact via:
  - Message relays (ZK, TEE, multisig)
  - Validator signatures
  - State snapshot proofs

## üß™ Example Use Cases

- **Dubai Land Registry Chain**
  - 4-node POA system integrated with DLD
  - Real-time deed issuance, title transfer, and mortgage lifecycle on-chain

- **New York Credit Chain**
  - US-regulated permissioned chain for mortgage pools and compliance-tracked stablecoins

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

- SDK allows for modular deployment and permission configuration.
- Compliance engine templates are region-specific but interoperable.
- Chains are indexed in Arda Core for routing and discovery.
