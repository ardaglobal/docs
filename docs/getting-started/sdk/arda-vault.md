# Arda Vault

---

## Overview

Arda Vault is the privacy-preserving data layer for sensitive legal, financial, and identity-related documents and metadata. It ensures compliance with data residency laws, preserves confidentiality, and enables cryptographic verification of off-chain documents tied to on-chain state.

Arda Vault is foundational for asset legitimacy, compliance, auditability, and regulator access.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Secure Document Storage**

- Documents stored off-chain with hash anchoring on-chain.
- Storage backends may include:
  - Encrypted cloud storage (jurisdictional)
  - Distributed storage (IPFS/Filecoin)
  - Government/private APIs

### 2. **Encryption and Access Control**

- Uses:
  - Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
  - Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
  - Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)
- Access scoped by:
  - Role (auditor, investor, agent)
  - Jurisdiction
  - Time window or event

### 3. **Document Types Supported**

- Title deeds, shareholder agreements, ID/KYC docs
- Valuation reports, inspection certificates
- Legal filings, tax forms
- Structuring memos, regulatory filings

### 4. **Vault Anchors**

- Every entry includes:
  - Hash (SHA-256 or Poseidon for ZK use)
  - Document type
  - Jurisdictional tag
  - Expiry or version number
  - Optional tags or doc linkage

## Compliance Applications

- KYC documents stored with attestation link to Wallet Group
- Real estate registry anchors linked to AssetTokens
- Automated expiry enforcement via EventHook
- Notary signatures or government validation may be hashed into Vault entries

---

## Query and Compute

- MPC or FHE allows:
  - "Yes/No" compliance proofs without revealing data
  - Statistical summaries (e.g. investor demographics)
  - Verification of document state without decrypting content

---

## Developer Notes

- Vault API includes:
  - `registerDoc()`, `getHash()`, `verifyAccess()`
- Access granted via key attestations or agent permissions
- Frontends can reference Vault docs by hash ID, not content
