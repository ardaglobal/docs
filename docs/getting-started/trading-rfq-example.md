# Trading RFQ Example

---

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to execute a compliant off-chain negotiated trade using Arda Trading's Request-for-Quote (RFQ) engine. It simulates a fractional real estate token being offered and acquired through an RFQ flow, with embedded eligibility checks and escrowed settlement.

---

## Scenario Summary

A Tier 3 investor negotiates to acquire a 5% stake in a Dubai residential building via an RFQ exchange with a Tier 2 seller. Settlement is delayed until regulatory approval and escrow validation.

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. **List RFQ Offer**

- Seller calls `createRFQ()` via SDK:
    - Token: `AssetToken.009`
    - Quantity: 5,000 (5% stake)
    - Ask price: $50,000
    - Valid for: 72 hours
    - Conditions: UAE KYC Tier 2+ buyer only

### 2. **Buyer Discovery and Validation**

- RFQ listed in Arda Trading portal
- Buyer (Tier 3, accredited) initiates `respondToRFQ()`
- Compliance engine runs:
    - Jurisdictional match → ✅
    - KYC Tier match → ✅
    - Holding limit → ✅

### 3. **Escrow Setup**

- Buyer deposits $50,000 in `TEST.USD` via PermissionedPool
- Seller pre-commits 5,000 tokens to escrow contract
- Both parties sign execution intent

### 4. **Arda Clear Settlement**

- SettlementQueue entry created
- Compliance re-check executed before final swap
- Delay buffer: 24h for optional regulator review
- Final token transfer and fund release triggered by `finalizeRFQTrade()`
