## üß≠ Overview

Arda is a vertically integrated operating system for real estate and structured private capital markets. It transforms real-world assets into programmable, compliance-first digital instruments, enabling global liquidity, institutional-grade compliance, and seamless financial innovation.

This documentation provides a full specification of Arda‚Äôs protocol architecture, primitives, products, deployment strategies, and integration layers. It is designed for developers, integrators, regulators, and contributors to the Arda ecosystem.

## üß± Key Concepts

- **Arda Core**: The foundational global coordination layer that handles compliance, identity, registry, and liquidity routing.
- **Arda OS**: Regional execution environments tailored to sovereign compliance, privacy, and legal constraints.
- **Arda Vault**: Privacy-preserving data infrastructure for encrypted ownership, legal, and financial documents.
- **Arda Capital**: A programmable capital formation and lending layer with embedded underwriting and syndication.
- **Arda Trading**: A hybrid RFQ and orderbook system enabling secondary markets for tokenized real estate and structured products.
- **Arda Clear**: A cross-chain, jurisdiction-aware clearing and settlement engine for asset transfers and deal execution.
- **Programmable Agents**: AI-native orchestration logic for structuring, monitoring, diligence, and matching.
- **Semantic Intelligence Layer**: A standardized data model that turns fragmented deal data into machine-readable intelligence.
