# Arda Clear

---

## Overview

Arda Clear is the clearing and settlement module within Arda Core. It is responsible for resolving asset and capital flows across participants, pools, and chains. Arda Clear enables near-instant, compliance-aware settlement of transactions including primary issuance, secondary trading, syndicated capital allocation, and loan repayment.

It ensures that all transfers respect jurisdictional rules, netting configurations, escrow conditions, and time-based maturity logic.

2. **Compliance Check** – JurisdictionProfile and TransferRule evaluated.
3. **Escrow Hold (if applicable)** – Funds or tokens placed in escrow.
4. **Netting & Matching** – Debits and credits resolved across parties.
5. **Finalization** – Tokens and/or funds are transferred, state is committed.
6. **Audit Log Update** – Result logged for traceability.
