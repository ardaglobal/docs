# Arda State Reconciliation & Snapshot Architecture

**Date:** 2025-06-25  
**Prepared for:** Arda Protocol Engineering Team  
**Purpose:** Design specification for implementing deterministic, auditable, and efficient state reconciliation in Arda

---

## üìå Context & Motivation

Arda aims to serve as the global operating system for programmable private capital. As part of this mission, it must provide a robust, transparent, and scalable mechanism to maintain the integrity of on-chain financial state and ensure efficient compliance, analytics, and settlement workflows.

One challenge in modern blockchain architectures is the overhead required to reconstruct full state or verify past balances through full transaction replay. Arda is exploring a native reconciliation architecture that allows for:

- Periodic state snapshotting
- Audit-ready reporting
- Reduced memory and query load
- Programmatic compliance monitoring
- AI and agentic data access

---

## üß© Functional Objectives

- Persist deterministic state snapshots of Arda‚Äôs financial primitives (wallets, entities, token balances, facilities)
- Enable fast, auditable queries over historical state
- Allow structured tracking of state changes and compliance-relevant transitions
- Support jurisdictional scoping and auditability

---

## üîß Architecture Components

### 1. **State Snapshot Module**

- Periodically traverses the full key-value state
- Serializes the canonical state of entities, wallets, and contracts
- Persists snapshots in versioned, on-disk or IPFS-compatible formats
- Commits the Merkle root of each snapshot on-chain:

  ```json
  {
    "event": "StateSnapshotCommitted",
    "root_hash": "abc123...",
    "block_height": 345600,
    "timestamp": "2025-06-25T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

### 2. **Snapshot Query Interface**

- Supports time-based and block-based queries:
  - "What was wallet 0xABC‚Äôs balance on 2025-06-01?"
- Integrates with `FacilityRegistry`, `WalletGroup`, and `AuditLog` modules

### 3. **Structured Append-Only Logs**

- All state transitions emit machine-readable events
- Indexed by `EntityID`, `JurisdictionID`, `TokenID`
- Enables forensic reconstruction and regulatory inspection

### 4. **Event-Triggered Reconciliation**

- Triggers include:
  - Threshold crossings
  - Facility status transitions
  - Manual snapshot request
- Can reconcile per-region, per-token, or globally

### 5. **Compliance-Aware Design**

- Snapshots are scoped per `JurisdictionProfile`
- Stored in region-specific data stores for compliance (e.g., UAE-local S3)
- Supports regulator attestations and proofs of reconciliation

## üí° Benefits for Arda

| Category | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Compliance** | Fast auditability and regulator-facing proofs |
| **Performance** | Reduced need for in-memory state retention |
| **Automation** | Agents can rely on consistent, point-in-time data |
| **Security** | Immutable proof of past system states |
| **Analytics** | Enables structured, AI-friendly state feeds |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Targets

- `Vault`, `TokenFactory`, `Drawdown`, `WalletGroup`
- `AuditLog`, `EventHooks`, `SettlementQueue`, `JurisdictionProfile`

---

## üì¶ Developer Interface (SDK Hooks)

```ts
commitSnapshot(entityGroupId?: string): Promise<SnapshotHash>
getSnapshotAt(entityId: string, date: string): Promise<EntityState>
listSnapshots(entityId: string): Promise<SnapshotMeta[]>
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Finalize `ReconciledStateModule` schema
2. Implement snapshot commit/verify logic
3. Design SDK + UI integrations for query and inspection
4. Configure scheduled and event-based snapshot triggers
5. Pilot with select jurisdictions (e.g., UAE)
