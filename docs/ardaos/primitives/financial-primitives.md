# Financial Primitives

Financial primitives in Arda define the contract-level representations of capital, debt, yield, and structured risk. These standardized components enable composable financial engineering while maintaining compliance and lifecycle guarantees.

They serve as the foundation for Arda Capital, Arda Trading, and Arda Clear flows, and are fully compatible with legal wrappers and governance layers.

## Primary Primitives

### 1. **DebtToken**

- Represents a borrower's obligation to repay a lender or syndicate.
- Attributes:
    - Principal
    - Interest rate (fixed/floating)
    - Term, maturity date
    - Collateral reference

### 2. **YieldToken**

- Tracks entitlement to income generated by assets (e.g. rent, interest).
- May be linked to:
    - A facility (pro-rata)
    - A tranche (risk-tiered)
    - A pool of assets (e.g. REIT-like structure)

### 3. **TrancheToken**

- Represents a risk layer within a structured facility.
- Tied to a `Waterfall` that dictates payment priority.
- Types:
    - Senior
    - Mezzanine
    - Equity

### 4. **PermissionedPool**

- Constrained capital pool enforcing:
    - KYC tiers
    - Jurisdictional limits
    - Ticket size rules
- Used for:
    - Syndicated lending
    - Primary issuance
    - Token sale allocations

## Supporting Logic

### 5. **Drawdown**

- Event triggered when funds are disbursed from a facility.
- Instantiates or updates a DebtToken.

### 6. **InterestAccrual**

- Defines how and when interest is added to outstanding principal.
- May use oracle input for variable rates.

### 7. **Repayment / Burn**

- Used to:
    - Reduce principal
    - Trigger maturity
    - Finalize facility or tranche

---

## Structuring & Monitoring

### 8. **Waterfall**

- Defines how cash flows are distributed across TrancheTokens.
- Supports:
    - Min/max return thresholds
    - Cumulative loss absorption
    - Reset or ratchet logic

### 9. **PaymentSchedule**

- Enforces recurring or event-based cash flow.
- Includes:
    - Frequency
    - Penalty tiers
    - Grace periods

## Derived Instruments

Arda supports higher-order instruments via combinations of primitives:

- Tokenized REITs
- Programmatic SPVs
- Insurance-linked tranches
- Credit-enhanced yield strategies
