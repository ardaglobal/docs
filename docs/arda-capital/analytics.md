# Analytics & Reporting

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview

The Analytics module in Arda Capital provides real-time, on-chain and off-chain performance insights for loans, pools, tranches, and portfolios. It leverages protocol-native data structures, observability agents, and risk primitives to power dashboards, reports, and agent-based triggers.

Analytics is critical for investors, syndicate managers, regulators, and governance actors to track capital health, risk exposure, and compliance adherence.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| FacilityRegistry | Canonical index of all active and historical loan structures |
| TrancheIndex | Aggregated tranche-level performance and exposure metrics |
| RiskPrimitives | Shared metrics such as PD, LGD, LTV, volatility, Sharpe ratio |
| DataOracles | External feeds (market rates, FX, index values, price benchmarks) |
| Monitoring Agents | Automated event detection (defaults, covenants, delays) |

## Example Metrics

- **Current LTV per loan or pool**
- **Tranche occupancy rate**
- **Interest paid vs scheduled**
- **Net capital outstanding**
- **Sharpe ratio of a tranche pool**
- **Exposure by region, property type, or risk class**
- **Defaults or missed payments (flagged by agent)**

{
  "loanId": "LN-1102",
