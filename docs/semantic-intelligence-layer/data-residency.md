# Data Residency

---

## Overview

Data residency in Arda ensures that sensitive data—such as personal identity, legal documents, and asset records—remain stored and processed within specific jurisdictions in compliance with local regulations. Arda's architecture separates data layers from consensus to enforce locality while maintaining cryptographic verifiability.

---

## Residency Strategies

### 1. **Jurisdictional Vault Nodes**

- Arda Vaults can be deployed regionally with:
  - FHE/MPC key hosting
  - Localized document anchors
  - Regulator access interface
- Documents never leave jurisdiction unless explicitly authorized

### 2. **Execution-Data Decoupling**

- ArdaOS executes business logic
- Documents and metadata resolved off-chain within local vault clusters
- Hashes, attestations, and ZK proofs shared globally

### 3. **Regulatory Scope Isolation**

- Each jurisdiction has:
  - Unique data control schema
  - Approved KYC/ID providers
  - Vault role-based access control
- Regional vaults may include:
  - Public agency key
  - Notary verification access
  - Legal override privileges

---

## Use Cases

- UAE DLD title data cannot leave local cloud under law
- Singapore MAS requires investor data retention in APAC
- U.S. SEC rules mandate audit logs remain queryable under FINRA standards

---

## Developer Notes

- SDK allows:
  - `registerRegionalVault()`, `verifyResidency()`
- Compliance checks validate residency on read/write
- Vault metadata includes region, purpose, and retention period

---

## Interop and Encryption

- Data can be mirrored across jurisdictions only with:
  - Attestation by owner or regulator
  - Double-keyed access (MPC share + regional gate)
- All metadata hashes traceable to Arda Core or AuditLog
