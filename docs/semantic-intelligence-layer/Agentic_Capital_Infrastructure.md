# Agentic Capital Infrastructure for Arda

## Executive Summary

Arda seeks to pioneer an on-chain infrastructure layer that enables AI agents to securely hold, manage, and deploy capital across programmable financial systems. This document outlines an initial architecture for a platform that supports "Agent-as-a-Service" capabilities, integrating decentralized identity, programmable permissions, compliance-first execution, and multi-chain operability.

## Goals

- Enable AI agents to function as economic actors.
- Support secure custody, transaction automation, and compliance.
- Provide enterprise-ready tooling for auditing and risk management.
- Establish Arda as the infrastructure provider for agentic capital.

## System Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. Agent Identity & Wallet

- Powered by DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) or Arda-native `Entity` + `WalletGroup`
- Linked to KYC tier, access scopes, and action logs

#### 2. Agent Wallet Control Layer

- Permissioning logic defined by `TransferRules`, `SpendingLimits`, `SpendingTriggers`
- Modular triggers for automatic payouts, streaming payments, etc.

#### 3. Programmable Safeguards

- Multi-sig wallet enforcement
- Time-locked funds
- Whitelisted contract destinations
- Budget caps per operation

#### 4. Auditability & Governance Hooks

- `AuditLog` for all agent actions
- `EventHooks` for state transitions (e.g., balance thresholds, external alerts)
- Optional approval queues for human oversight

#### 5. Cross-Chain Bridge Support

- Enable agents to move stablecoins/assets cross-chain
- ZK/TEE-based attestation for cross-domain identity and state consistency

#### 6. Agent Deployment Framework

- SDK to instantiate new agents
- Template libraries for common use cases (e.g. licensing bots, trading bots)

#### 7. Risk Scoring Engine

- Score agents on behavior, longevity, audit cleanliness
- Used to gate capital access, scale privileges, or revoke custody

## Sample Use Cases

- **Micro-Licensing Agent**: Autonomously purchases and resells data/image/API licenses.
- **Debt Syndication Bot**: Participates in permissioned `OrderBook` pools based on mandates.
- **Escrow Coordinator**: Mediates milestone-based payouts with dispute hooks.

## Compliance Architecture

- Each agent must be bound to a `JurisdictionProfile`
- Transaction flows validated through `TransferRules`
- All agent actions recorded to `AuditLog` and optionally mirrored to off-chain storage
- Optional custody relationship with human or org-level `Entity`

## Infrastructure Layers

| Layer               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent Wallet        | Multi-key, programmable wallet with embedded permissions                    |
| Compliance Kernel   | Real-time rule validation at transaction execution layer                    |
| Agent Registry      | Maintains agent metadata, risk scores, linked entities                      |
| SDK & Templates     | Client dev tools for agent deployment and interaction                       |
| Analytics Layer     | Monitors agent activity, anomalies, and external queries                    |

## Design Principles

- **Minimally Trusted**: Agents operate with constrained autonomy, bounded by explicit rules.
- **Composable**: Each agent behavior is modular—financial primitives (e.g. `Drawdown`, `SpendingLimit`) are reused across agents.
- **Auditable**: Agent state and history is continuously traceable and externally verifiable.
- **Jurisdictional Aware**: Regionality and compliance are first-class design inputs.

## Milestone Plan

1. **MVP Agent SDK**
   - Instantiate DID-linked agent
   - Basic spend rule enforcement
   - Event log generation

2. **Custodial & Delegated Agent Modes**
   - Shared wallet control
   - Manual override layer for institutions

3. **Cross-Chain Execution**
   - Bridging stablecoins for multi-domain activity
   - Attestation system for agent reputation transfer

4. **Risk & Scoring Framework**
   - Score-based privilege scaling
   - Circuit breakers for anomalous behavior

5. **Enterprise Integration APIs**
   - Exportable logs
   - Integration with legacy workflows for hybrid finance

## Final Thoughts

This is not just AI automation—it’s capital infrastructure for a machine-native economy. Arda is positioned to provide the governance substrate, compliance rails, and programmable primitives that will empower AI agents to transact safely and autonomously. This unlocks entirely new capital deployment mechanisms, liquidity models, and operational efficiencies.
